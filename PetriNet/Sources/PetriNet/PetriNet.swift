/// A Petri net.
///
/// `PetriNet` is a generic type, accepting two types representing the set of places and the set
/// of transitions that structurally compose the model. Both should conform to `CaseIterable`,
/// which guarantees that the set of places (resp. transitions) is bounded, and known statically.
/// The following example illustrates how to declare the places and transition of a simple Petri
/// net representing an on/off switch:
///
///     enum P: Place {
///       typealias Content = Int
///       case on, off
///     }
///
///     enum T: Transition {
///       case switchOn, switchOff
///     }
///
/// Petri net instances are created by providing the list of the preconditions and postconditions
/// that compose them. These should be provided in the form of arc descriptions (i.e. instances of
/// `ArcDescription`) and fed directly to the Petri net's initializer. The following example shows
/// how to create an instance of the on/off switch:
///
///
///     let model = PetriNet<P, T>(
///       .pre(from: .on, to: .switchOff),
///       .post(from: .switchOff, to: .off),
///       .pre(from: .off, to: .switchOn),
///       .post(from: .switchOn, to: .on),
///     )
///
/// Petri net instances only represent the structual part of the corresponding model, meaning that
/// markings should be stored externally. They can however be used to compute the marking resulting
/// from the firing of a particular transition, using the method `fire(transition:from:)`. The
/// following example illustrates this method's usage:
///
///     if let marking = model.fire(.switchOn, from: [.on: 0, .off: 1]) {
///       print(marking)
///     }
///     // Prints "[.on: 1, .off: 0]"
